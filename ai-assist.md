# AI Assistance Disclosure
```
During this project, I used ChatGPT as a **coding assistant** to speed up development.  
I did not rely on it to generate the entire codebase, but I **took inspiration from suggested design patterns, API structures, and integration snippets**.

## Areas AI Assisted

- **Boilerplate inspiration:**
  - Tailwind-based dashboard components  
  - Sample Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend

## Prompts Used (high level)

- *“JWT authentication in Spring Boot with stateless sessions and BCrypt passwords.”*  
- *“React AuthContext and ProtectedRoute pattern for JWT-based login.”*  
- *“Generate a dark mode Tailwind dashboard with Users, Candidates, and Audits.”*

## Validation

- I reviewed all AI suggestions manually.  
- Tested with **Postman** and **frontend integration**.  
- Adjusted DTOs, enums, and security annotations where AI suggestions didn’t compile or fit requirements.
